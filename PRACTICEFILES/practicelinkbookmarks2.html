    <p> Even though the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has admitted in a recent RTI query response to the
        use of facial recognition technology (FRT) for online verification of beneficiaries at vaccination centres, it
        failed to provide any legislative or legal order that authorised the use of such technology.

        The MoHFW has also said that no privacy impact assessment of the use of FRT was conducted prior to its
        deployment.

        “Facial recognition authentication is used as one of the methods for Aadhaar Authentication for online
        verification of beneficiary prior to COVID-19 vaccination wherein facial template is captured and send to UIDAI
        for verification of image of beneficiary,” the Ministry said in response to an RTI filed by the not-for-profit
        Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF).</p>

    <p> CBSE Class 10 and 12 syllabus will be rationalised similar to last year, says notification.
        With continuing school closures and examination disruptions due to COVID-19, the Central Board of Secondary
        Education (CBSE) has issued a new assessment scheme for Class 10 and 12 students this year.

        In 2021-22, it will reduce the syllabus, hold board examinations twice during the year in different formats, and
        ensure continuous recording of internal assessment scores in order to have a variety of options to calculate a
        final score at the end of the year, according to a notification issued on Monday night.

        This comes after widespread uncertainty during the 2020-21 academic year, when the second wave of COVID-19
        caused the postponement and then cancellation of year-end board examinations, with CBSE finally asking schools
        to use a combination of Class 10,11 and 12 scores and internal marks to calculate the final results.</p>
