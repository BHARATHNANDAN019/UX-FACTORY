        India administered 59.1 lakh (5.91 million) doses of COVID-19 vaccines until 9 p.m. on June 24. Uttar
        Pradesh recorded the highest number of vaccinations (8.2 lakh) followed by Madhya Pradesh (7.3 lakh) and Gujarat
        (4.3 lakh).

        Between June 1 and 23, 37.2 lakh doses were administered daily in India on average. At the current rate, a total
        of 100.3 crore doses can be administered by December 31, 2021, which is around 87.7 crore doses less than those
        required to fully vaccinate all adults (188 crore doses). To fully inoculate all adults by the end of this year,
        82.2 lakh doses need to be given daily on average in the country.

        The seven-day rolling average of daily vaccinations in the country continues to increase. It stood at 51.6 lakh
        on June 23, which is more than the 32.6 lakh recorded a week before (June 16). It was also significantly higher
        than the average daily doses recorded a month before (May 23) which was 18.8 lakh.
