    <p style="font-size: 30px;font-style: times new roman;">
        The Centreâ€™s new mission to ensure that every Class 3 child has foundational literacy and numeracy within five
        years will be rolled out on Monday. Although the National Education Policy had included a 2025 deadline to
        achieve the goal, the Centre has pushed back the target date to 2026-27, given that COVID-19 has already
        disrupted two academic years.

        The School Education Department says no additional funding is being allocated for the National Initiative for
        Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN Bharat). Instead, money is being allocated from
        the flagship Samagra Shiksha scheme, which actually saw a 20% drop in its budget this year.
